# Week 5 – Advanced CSS & Modern Layouts

## 🧠 What I Learned

This week, I explored **Advanced CSS** techniques that help build modern, responsive, and elegant user interfaces.
Concepts like CSS Grid, Flexbox, animations, and CSS variables made it easier to create clean layouts and reusable components. 🎨

## 🪄 Key Concepts

- 🧩 CSS Grid for complex, multi-section layouts
- 📐 Flexbox (advanced) for responsive component alignment
- 🎨 CSS Variables for theming and reusable styles
- 💫 CSS animations & transitions for smooth UI interactions
- 🔎 Advanced selectors + pseudo-classes & pseudo-elements
- 🧱 CSS Methodologies (BEM, SMACSS) for clean architecture

---

## 💻 What I Did

1. Built multiple layouts using CSS Grid.
2. Created responsive menus using Flexbox.
3. Implemented theme switching using :root custom properties.
4. Added animations to cards, buttons & sections.
5. Used pseudo-elements for decoration and structure.
6. Reorganized CSS using the BEM methodology.
7. Tested responsiveness using DevTools and fixed layout issues.

## ⚙️ Algorithms & Logic Used

- 🌗 Theme Switching: JavaScript toggles a class to switch light/dark themes.
- 📐 Responsive Grid: auto-fit + minmax() adjusts the layout for all screen sizes.
- 📦 BEM Styling: CSS written in a modular and scalable format.
- ✨ UI Animations: Keyframes used for fade-in and hover effects.

## ✔️ Testing Evidence

1️⃣ Theme Switch Test

- Expected: Theme changes when clicking the switch
- Result: ✔️ Works correctly

2️⃣ Responsive Layout Test

- Expected: Layout adjusts on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Result: ✔️ Fully responsive

3️⃣ Hover Animation Test

- Expected: Card lifts and shadow appears on hover
- Result: ✔️ Animation works smoothly

4️⃣ File Linking Test

- Expected: All CSS/JS files load without errors
- Result: ✔️ Verified

5️⃣ Browser Compatibility Test

- Expected: Layout works across major browsers
- Result: ✔️ Passed on Chrome, Firefox, Edge
