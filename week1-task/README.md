# Week 1 – HTML Basics

## Overview
This week, I learned the fundamentals of HTML and built my first personal portfolio page using only HTML.  
It helped me understand how web pages are structured and how different HTML tags work together to create content.

## What I Learned
- What HTML is and how it forms the structure of a web page  
- Basic tags: headings, paragraphs, lists, links  
- Creating forms with input fields, labels, and buttons  
- Adding images and videos to a page  
- Using HTML5 semantic elements like header, nav, main, and footer  
- Organizing a clean and readable page layout

## Practice Work
1. Set up VS Code as my editor  
2. Created my first `index.html` file  
3. Built a simple bio page with my details  
4. Added a contact form with name, email, and message fields  
5. Inserted images and working links  
6. Explored elements using browser developer tools

## Project
**Personal Portfolio Page**

Sections included:
- Header with my name and navigation  
- About section with my introduction  
- Skills section listing my abilities  
- Projects section describing my work  
- Contact form for messages  
- Footer with links and copyright

## Folder Structure
```bash
repo/
└── week1/
├── index.html
├── images/
└── README.md

```

## Tips I Followed
- Focused only on structure, not styling  
- Used semantic HTML for better readability  
- Validated my code using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org)  
- Kept indentation neat and clean
