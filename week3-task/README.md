# ⚡ Week 3 – JavaScript Basics & Interactivity

## 🧠 What I Learned
This week, I learned how to use **JavaScript** to make web pages interactive instead of just static.  
I used JS to work with the DOM, handle events, and update the page dynamically based on user actions.

---

## 🪄 Key Concepts
- 🧮 What JavaScript is and how it runs in the browser  
- 📦 Variables and data (storing task information)  
- 🧱 DOM manipulation – selecting and updating elements  
- 🎯 Event handling – clicks, form submit, button actions  
- ✅ Basic form validation (checking if input is empty)  
- 💾 Using `localStorage` to save tasks in the browser  

---

## 💻 What I Built
✨ **Project:** Simple Interactive Task Manager

Features:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as **Done / Undo**
- Delete tasks
- Tasks are saved in **localStorage**, so they stay after refresh

This project helped me practice:
- Working with arrays and objects in JS  
- Updating the DOM when data changes  
- Connecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together in one page

## ⚙️ Algorithms & Logic Used

- 🧠 **DOM Selection Logic :** Used getElementById and querySelector to access elements.
- 🎯 **Event Listener Logic :** Responded to user actions like clicks and form submission.
- 🎯 **Event Listener Logic :** Responded to user actions like clicks and form submission.
- 💾 **Local Storage Logic :** Stored and retrieved tasks and preferences from the browser.
