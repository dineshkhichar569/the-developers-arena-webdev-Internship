# ⚡ Week 3 – JavaScript Basics & Interactivity

## 🧠 What I Learned
This week, I learned how to use **JavaScript** to make web pages interactive instead of just static.  
I used JS to work with the DOM, handle events, and update the page dynamically based on user actions.

---

## 🪄 Key Concepts
- 🧮 What JavaScript is and how it runs in the browser  
- 📦 Variables and data (storing task information)  
- 🧱 DOM manipulation – selecting and updating elements  
- 🎯 Event handling – clicks, form submit, button actions  
- ✅ Basic form validation (checking if input is empty)  
- 💾 Using `localStorage` to save tasks in the browser  

---

## 💻 What I Built
✨ **Project:** Simple Interactive Task Manager

Features:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as **Done / Undo**
- Delete tasks
- Tasks are saved in **localStorage**, so they stay after refresh

This project helped me practice:
- Working with arrays and objects in JS  
- Updating the DOM when data changes  
- Connecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together in one page

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the `week3` folder.
2. Double-click `task-manager.html`.
3. The Task Manager will open in your browser.
4. Add some tasks and refresh the page to see that they are still saved.
