# Week 7 – Introduction to React.js

## 🧠 What I Learned

This week, I learned the fundamentals of React.js and how modern frontend applications are built using a component-based architecture. I understood how React efficiently manages UI using state, props, and hooks, and how to build dynamic and scalable applications.

## 🪄 Key Concepts

- What is React & component-based architecture
- JSX syntax and JavaScript expressions
- Functional components vs class components
- State & Props
- React Hooks: useState, useEffect
- Event handling in React
- Local Storage persistence
- Reusable component architecture

---

## 💻 What I Did

1. Set up a React development environment.
2. Created functional components using JSX.
3. Managed dynamic state using useState.
4. Used useEffect for side effects and persistence.
5. Built a Task Manager application with CRUD operations.
6. Implemented task completion toggling.
7. Stored tasks using Local Storage.
8. Structured the app using reusable components.
9. Styled the UI for clarity and usability.

## ⚙️ Algorithms & Logic Used

- **State Management:** Used useState to handle task data.
- **Side Effects Handling:** useEffect used to sync data with Local Storage.
- **Unique IDs:** Date.now() used for task identification.
- **Immutable Updates:** map() and filter() used to update state safely.
- **Component Communication:** Props used for data flow between components.

## ✔️ Testing Evidence

1. Add Task Test  
   - Expected: Task added successfully  
   - Result: ✔️ Passed

2. Delete Task Test  
   - Expected: Task removed from list  
   - Result: ✔️ Passed

3. Toggle Completion Test  
   - Expected: Task status toggles  
   - Result: ✔️ Passed

4. Local Storage Test  
   - Expected: Tasks persist after reload  
   - Result: ✔️ Passed

5. Component Render Test  
   - Expected: No console errors  
   - Result: ✔️ Passed
